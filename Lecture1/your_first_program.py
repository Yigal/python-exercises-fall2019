# Welcome to KOLT Python Certificate Program!
# Lines that begin with '#' symbol are single line comments.
# Python will ignore these lines. They are purely for humans, like you.
"""
 You can also see multiline comments.
 They start and end with triple quotes.
 Usually comments are used to document the code and
 make it more easy to understand.
 However, we will also use comments to guide you or 
 give instructions in exercises and assignments.
